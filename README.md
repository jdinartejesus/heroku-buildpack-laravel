	Forked from the Official <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php">Heroku PHP Buildpack</a> with added support for Laravel Applications.
</p>




## Usage

You'll need to use at least an empty `composer.json` in your application.

```sh
echo '{}' > composer.json
git add composer.json
git commit -m "add composer.json for PHP app detection"
```

If you also have files from other frameworks or languages that could trigger another buildpack to detect your application as one of its own, e.g. a `package.json` which might cause your code to be detected as a Node.js application even if it is a PHP application, then you need to manually set your application to use this buildpack:

    heroku buildpacks:set gerardbalaoro/php-laravel
    
The `gerardbalaoro/php-laravel` buildpack from the [Heroku Registry](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-registry) represents the latest stable version of the buildpack. If you'd like to use the code from this Github repository, you can set your buildpack to the Github URL:

    heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/GerardBalaoro/heroku-buildpack-laravel.git

Please refer to [Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/php) for further usage instructions.



## Environment Variables

The buildpack will **replace** the existing **.env** file using variables from your **Heroku Config Vars**.

### Generic Variables

The buildpack will recognize the **APP_**, **DB_**, and **MAIL_** variables set in Heroku.

```sh
# Adds APP_NAME="Laravel App" to .env file
heroku config:set APP_NAME="Laravel App"
```

The following are the supported application variables:
- APP_NAME
- APP_ENV
- APP_DEBUG
- APP_URL

For database configuration variables:
- DB_CONN (Database Driver)
- DB_HOST
- DB_PORT
- DB_USER
- DB_PASS
- DB_NAME (Database Name)

For email configuration variables:
- MAIL_DRIVER
- MAIL_HOST
- MAIL_USER
- MAIL_PASS
- MAIL_PORT

### Additional Variables

For environment variables not metioned above, define them in the config variable **LARAVEL_ENV_VARS** and it will automatically be appended to the **.env** file.

```sh
# Adds BROADCAST_DRIVER=log to .env file
heroku config:set LARAVEL_ENV_VARS=BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
```

Unfortunately, the `heroku config:set` command only works for single-line strings, for multiple environment variables, set them at your Heroku application dashboard under the settings tab.

## Laravel Commands

The buildpack automatically runs the following artisan commands:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
php artisan view:clear
```

To run additional commands, set assign them to the config variable **LARAVEL_COMMANDS**

```sh
# Executes php artisan migrate and php artisan db:seed
heroku config:set LARAVEL_COMMANDS=php artisan migrate && php artisan db:seed
```



## HTTP Basic Authentication
This will generate an **.htpasswd** file based on the config variable **HT_AUTH**

```sh
# Executes htpasswd -cb .htpasswd {username} {password}
heroku config:set HT_AUTH={username} {password}
```

It will also append the authentication code in **public/.htaccess**

```apache
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Access"
AuthUserFile /app/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```
